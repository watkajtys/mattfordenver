    <title>Revitilize Denver with Watkajtys</title>
</head>

<body>

    <h1>Matt Watkajtys for Denver Mayor</h1>
    <h2>Who? Matt Watkajtys (Wa-Kite-Us) - Candidate Matt?</h2>
    <p>Matt has rented in the Golden Triangle in Denver since 2017. Born in Upstate, NY - Matt has lived in Toronto, Los Angeles, and Manhattan. He worked as a product development consultant before
        Covid. During the lockdowns, he applied for unemployment. To make ends meet, he worked at an Amazon Fulfillment center and as a delivery driver. He is currently utilizing the
        Emergency Rent Relief program in 2021. He commutes mostly by ebike and trains his dog in detection work!</p>

    <h2>Political experience?</h2>
    <p>No. Startup experience. Looking at metrics, finding consensus, shipping results. <br>
        Denver (D10) needs a vision. I have one.<br>
        Matt is an Eagle Scout, a creative, and a startup operator. I was also pretty great at Model United Nations in High School and College.
    </p>

    <h2>Why Run?</h2>
    <p>This is the single most import election cycle in Denver's recent history. I love my neighborhood in the Golden Triangle, and I'm worried about the future of this city.</p>
    <p>District 10 is the most urban district in Denver, what I would consider Denver's Core. I've watched my neighborhood grow, decay, grow some more in the short time I've lived here.</p>
    <p>I live in D10, I work here, I sit at Levan Deli on 14th and Cherokee with my dog many mornings. I am at Civic Center Park every single day. I love Union Station and the core entrance to our beautiful city.</p>

    <h2>Hard Conversations to Have</h2>
    <p>Denver. Our city is having problems. It's not just us. It's nationwide.</p>
    <p>Our downtown is threatened. Our communities are threatened. So we need to talk. Let me tell you what I'm about.</p>

    <p>The moment the world locked down in 2020, everything changed. Denver needs to change as quickly as Covid has impacted us.</p>
    <p>It'll hurt. We need to admit our roads have gotten away from us. We'll have to lose a few parking spaces and shift some roads to one-ways. You'll have to suffer through new traffic patterns. We'll have to take radical action on homelessness and fentanyl. Some of these changes will be scary and sound counter-intuitive. You might not like some of these changes. But they are steps we will have to take to course-correct this city.</p>

    <h2>It's Not All Bad</h2>
    <p>Denver, we don't stand up for ourselves enough. We do not give the Denver in Decay people enough pushback - District 10 is incredible. Denver is a cool city. We need to share our Denver Pride.</p>

    <h2>The Revitalization</h2>
    <p>Denver, like many cities in America, has had a rough go at it lately. And the next few years will be absolutely critical to surviving and thriving.</p>
    <p>The cities that thrive will be the ones to notice the world has changed.</p>

    <h2>Campaign Priorities</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Infrastructure and a failed vision zero
            <ul>
                <li>Sweeping and immediate infrastructure adjustments.</li>
                <li>Denver's Infrastructure wasn't designed for the density we have - Denver has failed to adapt quickly enough. The time to act is now.</li>
                <li>A prioritization of the 5280 loop - a pedestrian and bikeway/scooterway encircling the Downtown Core.</li>
                <li>An immediate deployment of protected bikeways/scooterways throughout the city</li>
                <li>Traffic easing measures on eligible and problematic streets.</li>
                <li>A reclamation of eligible streets to pedestrian and car-free areas.</li>
                <li>A citywide initiative to rebuild (or build) our sidewalks.</li>
                <li>Adapting COVID shared streets to one-way with a protected bikeway/scooterway. This both allows easy transit of the city and access to homes. I'm looking at 11th, go one-lane one-way and a bi-way bikeway in the freed lane.</li>
                <li>A concerted cleanup effort at transit hubs citywide - zero tolerance in critical transit hubs.</li>
                <li>Union Station and High Trafficked areas within D10 and citywide should be safe and feel safe.</li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
                <li>A MoonShot</li>
                <li>The Mile High Mode Shift</li>
                <li>This infrastucture package will very likely require a bond as well as State and Federal support.</li>
                <li>The Mode Shift would immediately seek to deploy rapid-transit busways, specifically on Colfax.</li>
                <li>It would be Denver's Big Dig.</li>
                <li>Any infrastucture updates we cannot make due to budget constraints will be rolled into a bond package.</li>
                <li>Opposition will remark about parking. Everyone can admit driving/biking/walking sucks.</li>
                <li>Parking will need to adapt - the street belongs to the city.</li>
                <li>Vision Zero needs to start trending towards zero.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            Regaining Trust in Denver
            <ul>
                <li>Decryption of Emergency Broadcasts within Denver. At the very least journalistic access.</li>
                <li>Comprehensive review of rules of engagement by DPD officers.</li>
                <li>Expanding Foot Patrols, with the same officers, across the downtown area.</li>
                <li>Seeking technology alternatives amid an officer shortage.</li>
                <li>Expansion of lighting, HALO cameras, and Shotspotter to hot spots.</li>
                <li>Investigation into high-technology Drone response that is utilized in other cities.
                <li>A specific note on drones, these can be abused easily. I want to look into it.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>A Comprehensive Approach to Housing Stability
            <ul>
                <li>Immediate "low-hanging fruit" updates at shelter facilities (certain facilities for pets, for families).</li>
                <li>Immediate expansion of safe-camping centers.</li>
                <li>Expansion of eviction defense and emergency rent relief programs.</li>
                <li>Year over Year rent stabilization capped at prime + tbd, CPI shelter + tbd, or determined by independent commission.</li>
                <li>Supporting safe parking initiatives.</li>
                <li>Possible vacancy penalties both commercial and residential.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            Public Safety Reformations
            <ul>
                <li>Crackdown on Catalytic Converter and Car Thefts - <a href="https://leg.colorado.gov/bills/sb22-009">SB-009</a>,
                    and locally Denver PD has presented a bill to the current administration.
                </li>
                <li>Once shelter overhauls are complete, Denver will enforce the camping ban. Once we have humane capacity, the ban will be enforced. It is not dignified to die on the street.
                </li>
                <li>Reclaimation of treelawns citywide - rocks and fences are dangerous and unsightly. Tree and folliage replacement programs. Creative treelawn possibilties. This issue is prevelant throughout District 10.
                </li>
                <li>Concerted cleanup effort and ongoing support in highly trafficked public areas (Union Station Included).</li>
                <li>Union Station is critical to Denver's ability to operate on a global scale. We need to ensure critical infrastructure is safe and inviting. The pipeline from DEN to the A-line to Union Station, the bus station, and the downtown core will become critical as the macroeconomic environment contracts. Denver will need to get its 'mojo' back to become the 'go-to' host city for events.</li>
                <li>We all deserve to feel safe in our city. We have to admit we have a problem. And we have to act
                    humanely. Large swaths of critical infrastructure have become unsafe. That includes critical sidewalks, critical RTD stations, and critical city and regional infrastucture.
                </li>
                <li>Expansion of the STAR program within Denver for mental health and low level crimes.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            Fentanyl - a radical approach is required
            <ul>
                <li>Safe injection sites throughout Denver.</li>
                <li>Free essential supplies in free vending machines on city property containing testing materials, first
                    aid, sexual health, and drug health.
                </li>
                <li>More programming</li>
                <li>Continued support and monitoring of Fentanyl felonization at low levels.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            Scooters are here to stay
            <ul>
                <li>Infrastructure first. The Mile High Mode Shift. Immediate deployments of bikeways/scooterways on already traveled routes.</li>
                <li>Scooter users have "Safe Lane Detection Technology" - their brains. If they see a safe lane, they'll use it.</li>
                <li>Removing the vendor cap - we need more last mile solutions, not fewer. I miss denver BCycle. I miss
                    cheap scooter and ebike rides. Possible city deployed ebike solution?
                </li>
                <li>Creation and expansion of scooter/bike parking areas on the bikeways/scooterways</li>
                <li>Heavier enforcement of proper scooter parking</li>
                <li>Enforcement of DUIs on scooters</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            Vision Zero.
            <ul>
                <li>Has failed. Full stop.</li>
                <li>Infrastucture first. Mile High Mode Shift. Traffic easing measures, dedicated non-car lanes on eligible roads.</li>
                <li>Light retiming across the Denver Metro.</li>
                <li>Fasttrack 5280 loop.</li>
                <li>Fasttrack Colfax Rapid Transit Corridor.</li>
                <li>Immediate sidewalk repair, replace, and buildout campaign.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>A Changing Downtown
            <ul>
                <li>Offices aren't coming back. That's a fact.</li>
                <li>Incentivize conversions from office space to mixed use residential space.</li>
                <li>Shifting 16th street busses off of the mall to create a fully pedestrian plaza.</li>
                <li>Champion city music, art, and cultural events in newly closed city areas.</li>
                <li>Possible large activations in LoDo to shut down roads, increase safety and security. Design outdoor social consumption areas near LoDo and the ballpark.</li>
                <li>Faster city response to illegal campsites within the confines of the law.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            Unleashed Dogs - Adapt to and Regulate
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Dedicated "barky hour" at public parks with the most off leash occurrences in the mornings and evenings.
                    Zero tolerance policy in parks outside of those hours. We will have rangers ticket.
                </li>
                <li>Higher enforcement priority</li>
                <li>Continue to build dog parks in the city using offleash complaints as a guide.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            Garbage and Recycling
            <ul>
                <li>Investigation into lack of pickup and alley pickup rather than street pickup in applicable areas.</li>
                <li>More recycling efforts! More composting efforts!</li>
                <li>It's incredibly hard to recycle here. Our municipal diversion rate is only 15%!</li>
                <li>Recycling and Compost should be free!</li>
                <li>Incentives for Apartment buildings to recycle and compost.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            A changing climate and Denver
            <ul>
                <li>Expansion of Denver's centralized steam system. Hook up as many buildings to the system as possible.
                </li>
                <li>Steam activation is in direct opposition to Mayor Hancock's and would require some backtracking with XCel.</li>
                <li>Steam can provide both heating and cooling. Our system is one of the most comprehensive in the world.</li>
                <li>This is a climate action as well as a resiliancy action - we want more buildings on centralized steam!</li>
                <li>A wide deployment of trees and other native foliage for eligible treelawns throughout the city with priority attention given to tree-bare neighborhoods. Trees reduce ambient
                    temperatures and is critical for a climate resiliant future.
                </li>
                <li>Greening any new traffic-calming measures and any available and under-greened city spaces.</li>
                <li>Reimplementation of the Green Roof initiative that Denver voters have already voiced their opinion on.</li>
                <li>An audit of climate vulnerabilities specific to Denver - from fire threats to flash flooding events to
                    heavy snow events, Denver needs a plan.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            Emergency Preparedness
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Citywide plans for every national security emergency possible. Office of Emergency management handles this, but we're going to give them additional funding.
                </li>
                <li>Particular attention paid to excessive heat, rain, and localized fire threats.</li>
                <li>Possible Bond measure for critical improvements (storm water drainage, fire mitigation)</li>
                <li>Prepare additional cooling centers, make more water refill (ability to fill water bottles!) stations available citywide.</li>
                <li>Extensive crowd-control training by all necessary .</li>
                <li>Regular response tests to ensure Denver is ready.</li>
                <li>Improvements to Denver's crisis center.</li>
            </ul>

        <li>
            Our 'Mojo' got lost - let's bring it back.
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Denver, this means we need to fund the arts. Other cities in this nation are also losing their mojo and it's time to compete on a nationwide scale.
                </li>
                <li>Art and entertainment spending is critical to change the narrative as a cool city. We have the sports talent. We have the venues. We need more. And we need to be public about it.</li>
                <li>Other cities are losing their big entertainment events because of city or state politics. Denver can, and should, attract those events that are looking for new homes.</li>
                <li>Denver has beautiful murals and public art works, lets get more. Let's be known as an art an event capitol of the United States.</li>
                <li>We have the best venues in the world, Redrocks, Levitt, Mission...</li>
            </ul>
        </li>

        <li>
            Move Smart. Move Fast.
            <ul>
                <li>Denver, the next decade might be a rough time. Recession, depression, we need to be ready for a downturn.</li>
                <li>It's a requirement to move as quickly as humanely possible to beat the worst of the downturn.</li>
                <li>We need data. We need KPIs (Key Performance Indicator) on every major change we make.</li>
                <li>I mention bonds again, we need to prepare to swallow a few to jumpstart Denver.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>

        <li>
            LetOut and Downtown
            <ul>
                <li>Food Trucks deserve to be at LetOut. Feeding inebriated citizens is a public safety priority.</li>
                <li>Investigation into social consumption near the ballpark/applicable areas</li>
                <li>Possible extension of closing time or lastcall to ease choke points.</li>
                <li>Additional food truck placement opprotunities for food entrepreneurs.</li>

                <li>An investigation into Cannabis Delivery uptake and opening the delivery pool to anyone who wishes to build a company.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>The Opposition - Let's talk.</h2>
    <ul>
            <p>Why do people have political websites only tell you to donate to their campaign. Let's try something new. I'll speak as though you asked.</p>

            <li><h4>Don't touch the Roads! Denver traffic is bad enough!</h4><br>
            Which is why our streets have gotten away from us. Denver got too big too quickly. We didn't adapt our infrastucture accordingly.
            We're going to lose some parking spaces. Some streets will become shared and one way. Some streets will be closed entirely.
            It's a change. But we're going to get through it together. We'll be stronger for it.</li>

            <li><h4>Scooters don't belong on the sidewalks! </h4><br>
                No. No they do not. Scooters have come close to running over my pup many a time. Things to consider.
                1) Where would you propose the scooters go? Infrastucture [Mile High Mode Shift]
                2) GPS isn't accurate enough to detect a sidewalk from a bikeway/scooterway. Let's put an end to that debate right now.
                3) City needs to provide "parking areas" on destination blocks.
            </li>

            <li>
                <h4>Where am I going to park? I deserve to park in front of my home!</h4> <br>
                The reality is the city changed, it grew. That's why your home is worth more today than it was in 2010.
                <br>
                We need to accept that as a fact. You may have to park a block away. You may have to pay for parking in certain areas. I pay to park. No one likes it, but we plan too heavily around cars. Maybe you won't vote for me. But I promise you that we can and will make the streets safer through design. Just let us do it.
            </li>

            <li><h4>It's a war on cars!</h4><br>
                It is not a war on cars. We are enabling safe alternative transportation. Some people in this city believe scooters are a menace, they are a menace because they currently live somewhere they shouldn't but are forced to. <br>
                No one likes finding parking - you drove a few miles to get icecream and now there is no where to park! Imagine having an ebike? Or renting a scooter? Taking a docked bike? Parking is solved.
            </li>

            <li><h4>Union Station (insert public space here) is meant for everyone [unhoused neighbors]!</h4><br>
                It is. However, when we use any public space we are signing a social contract. To carry out what you carry in. To treat the park and the people with respect.
                Union Station, in particular, and the A line should be a magnificent entrance into Downtown Denver. It is critical municipal infrastructure. Plainly, it is unacceptable to use these spaces in an untoward way.
                <br>
                This is why we must support programs such as safe injection sites and overdose prevention centers. Redirect people who need help to places that can help them.
            </li>

            <li><h4>Safe Injection Sites are Bad for Denver!</h4><br>
                I never liked the idea. I'll be honest. So, I get it. Let's look at this from 30,000 feet for a second, right?
                1) People are doing drugs in public spaces and we'd prefer them not to.
                2) People are dying.

                Drugs will be used, it's an unfortunate reality. Our opeoid crises got away from us.<br>
                We need to give drug users a safe space to use so they don't have to in the park or the alley by your home.
                <br>
                We also need to make testing and treatment options freely and widely available.
                <br>
                Fentanyl has made its way into just about every drug in Denver. Anyone should be able to get a test kit and NARCAN, free of charge, free of judgement.

            <li><h4>Don't promote bad behaviour!</h4><br>
                Denver, I told you we have a problem. Look around. These things are already happening. We have to accept that.
                On city property, we're going to install free vending machines with narcan, testing materials, period products, basic birth control and contraceptives, clean needles, basic first aid materials, and meal replacement bars.
                <br>
                They'll be in city buildings. They're there as a non-judgemental place to get what you need. The machine won't judge you. It won't ask you questions. We all need help. If you are struggling, you deserve to be safe. Especially now. That's on the city.

                <h4>An EBike doesn't belong on the bikelane!</h4> <br>
                As long as they go the speed limit (mine has a ClassII mode, it tops out at 15mph for bikelanes.) they're bikes. They belong. Scooters are coming too.

                <h4>We don't trust the police.</h4> <br>
                Denver Police have made mistakes. That's not up for debate. Let's tackle trust one at a time. <br>

                1) My priority is to decrypt Denver Emergency dispatch.<br>
                Dispatch is the heart of the city. We all deserve free access to it. You can encrypt if you have a tactical situation, but dispatch is public.
                <br>
                We need to examine use of force in Denver. Too many people are dying by police intervention. Too many people are getting hurt.
                <br>
                The city should start to trust officers again, but the officers need to show they should be trusted.
                In the Golden Triangle, we have a few officers on patrol or stationed. You see the same faces, you might not get their names, but you recognize them.
                <br>
                We need to do this more.
            </li>

            <li>
                <h4>You don't like police!</h4><br>
                I don't trust the police right now. Even I, a tall blonde white dude, have had bad experiences. But that doesn't mean I don't respect the officers who are still on the force.
                <br>
                This is the hard truth - we have a problem with use of lethal force in the city.
                Denver Police have not shown their communications department is trustworthy in reporting to the city. This is why we make dispatch public. To begin to trust again.
                <br>
                There will be adjustments, something went wrong in training. We identify and we adjust. Any action in regards to budget is designed not to defund anything, but to free Denver Police up to police. Free Denver Fire up to do their incredibly imporant jobs (thanks for saving Dozens on 13th and Cherokee btw).
                <br>
                It's hard to hear, but it's true. There are problems. We need to address them and we are going to.
            </li>

            <li><h4>What will Denver do in a post-Roe world?</h4>
                <br>
                Denver and Colorado are pro-choice. That won't change. We need to come to terms with the fact we are at war on a constitutional level.
                <br>
                Denver doesn't just need to provide for the women of Denver, we need to provide for the women around us. Denver is a constitutional island at the moment. The system will be under stress for the considerable future.

            <li><h4>Bikes don't follow the rules! They ran a stop sign!</h4> <br>
                Behold. The Idaho stop. It's now state law. A stop sign becomes a yield. I commute by bike, I'll explain.
                1) Stop sign approaches. It's clear ahead of me. I have a wider field of view than a car. I look left, right. That's clear. I throttle back up and go through. A yield.
                2) Stop light approaches. I try to filter up towards the front of the line if possible. Then I stop. I'm at a stop sign. If things clear up and I get a space, I start going.
                <br>
                Why do we do this?
                1) I see you. I promise you. I don't want to die.
                2) I can see more than you.
                3) Starting back up is incredibly labor-intensive - it's more efficient.
                4) At a light, I can filter up and be at speed by the time you catch up. Safer for everyone!

                Yes, people bike poorly. People also drive poorly. You've seen as many red lights ran as I have.

                <h4>Downtown sucks.</h4> <br>
                Not a question. It's not great. It's really not. We have problems downtown. It has the absolute potential to great. We're going to have to reclaim some roads near high trafficked areas. You'll still get foot traffic. Every city that has reclaimed streets has come to love it. We'll survive and thrive.
                <br>
                We also need to reclaim some public spaces from urban campsites. This is another infrastucture First policy. Once we build out humane short-term shelter and housing opprotunities for all, the campsite pressure will naturally decrease.
                <br>
                The world also changed, and downtown hasn't yet. Work from home isn't going away - our downtown needs to convert, rapidly, to residential and mixed use.
                The city needs to incentiveize downtown tower conversions from office space to residential. It's good for the building owners. It's good for Denver. It's good for housing.
                <br>
                Some of these changes will be scary. Covid changed our world. It isn't going back. Which is why we need to adapt just as quickly if we want to suvive and thrive during a difficult decade.

                <h4>Why are you running?</h4>
                <br>
                I'm worried.
                This election is the most important election Denver has had in a long while. The 2030's are a radically different world than the 2020's. We have to rethink things, act decisively, and quickly.
                <br>
                Why do I think, of all people, I can run a city of this size? Well, I learn quick. I was also really good in Model United Nations in College.
                <br>
                I have a vision. A vision that's been influenced by many conversations. We're going to hire the best people we can find. We're going to expand that vision. I'll admit, if you vote for me, I'll try to execute things as quickly as I can. If you don't want change or hate bikes, I am not your candidate.
            </li>

            <li><h4>What about the airport construction cost overages?</h4>
                <br>
                I am learning about the airport. I'll form a position later. Though, as someone (who used to) fly, I'm not happy. The people aren't happy. And I want answers.
                <br>
                I also think the A line should be as cheap (free) as possible and safe. Zero tolerance for poor behaviour in this zone. The Airport to the Train to Downtown should be seamless. We want to knock down some I70 traffic? That's a big way to do it.
            </li>

            <li><h4>Why does the city need to spend money to plan for a fire that hasn't happened yet? </h4><br>
                I spent my formative years in Manhattan. I lived across from World Trade for a few years. You'd often see NYPD's rapid response units staged. Taking up the entire block. You knew the city knew something. And it made you feel better.
                <br>
                Fact is, NYC had planned for every possible scenario so they could deploy assets quickly and know what to do under stress. Rumor was rapid response could get anywhere in 3 minutes.
                <br>
                Not to discount the Office of Emergency Management - we need to fund those fine people to better protect the city from threats we don't have on our bingo cards.
                <br>
                I want plans, I want drills, I want better response times. Denver needs to be ready for the next pandemic or, more likely, dangerous heat, widespread severe flooding, or an uncontained fire.
                <br>
                We also need to plan for a future we are seeing on the horizon. Cyberattacks, long-term power outages, severe supply chain constraints, or domestic terrorism. We need a command center that's fully modernized and prepared for any emergency situation, frankly - the city should have a command center.
                <br>
                This city has seen first hand what happens when communication fails and situations escalate. That won't happen again.
