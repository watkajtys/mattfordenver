    <title>Bring about the Revitalization Era with Matt for Denver</title>

    <h1>Matt Watkajtys for Denver Mayor</h1>

    <h2>Who? Matt Watkajtys</h2>
    <p>Matt has rented in the Golden Triangle in Denver since 2017. He worked as a product development consultant before covid. When Covid hit, Matt's income fell off a cliff. He applied for unemployment. He is currently utilizing the Emergency Rent Relief program in 2021. He commutes mostly by ebike and trains his dog in detection work!</p>

    <h2>Political experience?</h2>
    <p>No. Startup experiences. Looking at metrics, finding consensus, shipping results. The goal would be to hire the best domain experts we can find for critical city leadership. Denver needs visionary leadership. The city is running out of runway to make changes.</p>

    <h2>The Revitilization</h2>
    <p>Denver is rebuilding after Covid. Things will never be the same. That's a fact. The cities that thrive will be the ones to notice the world has changed.</p>
