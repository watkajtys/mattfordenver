    <title>Revitilize Denver with Matt Watkajtys</title>
</head>

<body>

    <h1>Matt Watkajtys for Denver Mayor</h1>
    <h2>Who? Matt Watkajtys (Wa-Kite-Us)</h2>
    <p>Matt has rented in the Golden Triangle in Denver since 2017. He worked as a product development consultant before
        covid. When Covid hit, Matt's income fell off a cliff. He applied for unemployment. He is currently utilizing the
        Emergency Rent Relief program in 2021. He commutes mostly by ebike and trains his dog in detection work!</p>

    <h2>Political experience?</h2>
    <p>No. Startup experience. Looking at metrics, finding consensus, shipping results. The goal would be to hire the best
        domain experts we can find for critical city leadership. Denver needs visionary leadership. The city is running out
        of runway to make changes.</p>

    <h2>Hard Conversations to Have</h2>
    <p>Denver. We have to talk. Our city is in trouble. It's not just us. It's nationwide.</p>
    <p>It's our time to admit we have problems. The way to solve those problems is meeting halfway. A terrifying proposal
        these days, but the truth.</p>
    <p>We have to take radical action and we have to take it now.</p>
    <p>The world changed in 2020. It's all different. Denver needs to change as quickly as Covid changed it.</p>

    <h2>The Revitalization</h2>
    <p>The cities that thrive will be the ones to notice the world has changed.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Infrastructure and a failed vision zero
            <ul>
                <li>Sweeping and immediate infrastructure adjustments</li>
                <li>Denver's Infrastructure wasn't designed for the density we have - the time to act is now.</li>
                <li>A prioritization of the 5280 loop</li>
                <li>An immediate deployment of protected bikeways/scooterways throughout the city.</li>
                <li>Traffic easing measures on eligible and problematic streets</li>
                <li>A reclamation of eligible streets to pedestrian and car-free areas.</li>
                <li>A citywide initiative to rebuild (or build) our sidewalks.</li>
                <li>A concerted cleanup effort at transit hubs citywide - zero tolerance in critical transit municipal
                    hubs
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            Regaining Trust in Denver
            <ul>
                <li>Decryption of Emergency Broadcasts within Denver</li>
                <li>Comprehensive review of rules of engagement by officers</li>
                <li>Expanding Foot Patrols, with the same officers, across the downtown area</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>A Comprehensive Approach to Housing Stability
            <ul>
                <li>Immediate "low-hanging fruit" updates at shelter facilities.</li>
                <li>Immediate expansion of safe-camping centers.</li>
                <li>Expansion of eviction defense and emergency rent relief programs.</li>
                <li>Year over Year rent stabilization capped at prime + tbd</li>
                <li>Supporting safe parking initiatives</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            Public Safety Reformations
            <ul>
                <li>Crackdown on Catalytic Converter and Car Thefts - <a href="https://leg.colorado.gov/bills/sb22-009">SB-009</a>,
                    and locally Denver PD has presented a bill to the current administration.
                </li>
                <li>Once shelter overhauls are complete, Denver will enforce the camping ban. Once we have humane capacity,
                    there will be no tolerance. It is not dignified to die on the street.
                </li>
                <li>Reclaimation of treelawns citywide - rocks and fences are dangerous and unsightly. (we have a tree
                    program, please!)
                </li>
                <li>Concerted cleanup effort in highly trafficked public areas (Union Station Included).</li>
                <li>Enforcement of the "camping ban" prioritizing camps that are most linked with threats to public
                    safety.
                </li>
                <li>We all deserve to feel safe in our city. We have to admit we have a problem. And we have to act
                    humanely.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>

                <li>Removing the vendor cap - we need more last mile solutions, not fewer. I miss denver BCycle. I miss
                    cheap scooter and ebike rides.
                </li>
                <li>Expansion of scooter/bike parking areas on the bikeways/scooterways</li>
                <li>Heavier enforcement of proper scooter parking</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            Vision Zero.
            <ul>
                <li>Has failed.</li>
                <li>Infrastucture first. Traffic easing measures, dedicated non-car lanes on eligible roads.</li>
                <li>Light retiming across the Denver Metro</li>
                <li>Fasttrack 5280 loop</li>

        </li>
        <li>
            Unleashed Dogs - Adapt to and Regulate
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Dedicated "barky hour" at public parks with the most offleash occurences in the mornings and evenings.
                    Zero tolerance policy in parks outside of those hours.
                </li>
                <li>Higher enforcement priority</li>
            </ul>
        </li>

                </li>
                <li>A wide deployment of trees for eligible treelawns throughout the city. Trees reduce ambient
